# Eagle-PCBs
This is a collection of some Eagle PCB designs that I created during my time working at the [Sacred Heart University IDEA Lab](https://www.sacredheart.edu/academics/colleges--schools/school-of-computer-science--engineering/facilities/idea-lab/).

## <a href="https://github.com/lcaraballoj/Arduino-Gamepad" target="_blank">Gamepad</a>
The Gamepad PCB is a PCB that was created for a USB gamepad powered by an Arduino Pro Micro. The PCB was utilized in a workshop in which participants could learn to through-hole solder using the custom PCBs.

## Pumpkin PCB
This was a PCB that was created for a workshop in which users learned to through-hold solder by soldering LEDs arranged to create a Jack O'Latern.

## SHUduino
This was a challenging PCB that was created with the intention of being used by the engineering students in order to teach them surface-mount soldering and to teach them to encode an Arduino. This PCB did not end up working, and there was not enough time to troublehsoot and the issues, but a lot of work was put into it and it ended up looking cool despite it not being functional.

## Snowflake
This was a PCB that was created in order to test out making our own PCBs in the IDEA Lab. We did this by using the the [Carvey](https://site.inventables.com/press/materials/carvey) by Inventables and copper plates in which we used the Carvey to carve the outline of our circuit.

(The SHU on the ends were added after testing on the Carvey)

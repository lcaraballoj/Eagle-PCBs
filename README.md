# Eagle-PCBs
This is a collection of some Eagle PCB designs that I created during my time working at the [Sacred Heart University IDEA Lab](https://www.sacredheart.edu/academics/colleges--schools/school-of-computer-science--engineering/facilities/idea-lab/).

## [Gamepad](https://github.com/lcaraballoj/Arduino-Gamepad)
The Gamepad PCB is a PCB that was created for a USB gamepad powered by a Arduino Pro Micro. The PCB was utilized in a workshop in which participants could learn to through-hole solder using the custom PCBs.
